        <figcaption class="time2"> 12:00 PM</figcaption>
        <figcaption>I took a bus tour and passed the Garden of the Gods park, which is famous national park in Colorado.
            There are a lot of beautiful red rocks. We didnâ€™t have chance to get off the bus and take a close look but I
            saw the famous rock called kissing camels.
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Bus driver who was very knowledgeable explained us why they called by that name. The top part of the
            rock
            looks like two camels are kissing so they called kissing camel. The kissing camel is located at the very top
            of North Gateway Rock so we could easily see it.

        <figcaption>I was surprised that there were still snow at the top of the mountains. Because of the weather
            problem, we could not go higher but it was enough to see this beautiful view.

        <figcaption>Me and my friend took a lot of picture and have a lot of snow on the surface, my friend could do
            snow angel
            on the snow. I really love this experience because this was the first time I have been to the mountain in
            U.S.
